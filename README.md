# Project Title: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Prediction Model


## Overview:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning-based model for the early diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). By leveraging ensemble techniques, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, ultimately assisting healthcare professionals in making timely decisions for better patient outcomes.


## Tools & Technologies:
Python: The primary programming language for building the model.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for implementing the various algorithms and ensemble models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Jupyter Notebook: For code development, documentation, and visualization.


## Project Workflow:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Dataset: The dataset contains 59 features related to patient health metrics (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.).

2. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and ensured data consistency.
Normalization/Standardization: Applied scaling to ensure all features are on a similar scale, improving model performance.

3. Feature Selection:
Why Feature Selection?: Out of 59 features, identifying the most relevant ones reduces computational complexity, avoids overfitting, and improves accuracy.
Method: Used techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and statistical methods to select the 10 most relevant features contributing to CAD diagnosis.

4. Machine Learning Algorithms:

The following five machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:
Logistic Regression: A simple linear model for binary classification.
Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that improves robustness and reduces overfitting.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A distance-based classification method.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Decision Tree: A tree-like structure that splits data based on feature values for classification.

5. Ensemble Model:
   
What is Ensemble Learning?: Combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce bias/variance.
Technique Used: A voting classifier (hard/soft voting) was employed, aggregating predictions from the five algorithms to create a more reliable model.
Purpose: By leveraging multiple models, ensemble learning mitigates the weaknesses of individual algorithms, enhancing diagnostic performance.
Model Evaluation:

## The model was evaluated using the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
Result: 97.77%
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all predicted positives (how accurate the positive predictions are).
Result: 97.90%
Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positives correctly identified (important for medical diagnoses).
Result: 97.77%
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
Result: 98.18%
These metrics indicate that the model performs exceptionally well in identifying patients with CAD, minimizing false negatives and ensuring reliable predictions.

## Purpose:
Early Diagnosis: By predicting CAD at an early stage, healthcare providers can intervene sooner, improving patient outcomes.
Resource Optimization: Accurate predictions help in optimizing hospital resources, reducing the burden of unnecessary tests and treatments.
Improved Patient Care: Enhances decision-making for doctors, leading to personalized and effective treatment plans.


## Conclusion:
The Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Prediction Model demonstrates the power of ensemble learning in medical diagnostics. By combining multiple machine learning algorithms and selecting the most relevant features, the model achieves high accuracy and reliability. This project can be a valuable tool in the healthcare industry for enhancing early detection, improving treatment strategies, and optimizing resources for better patient care.
